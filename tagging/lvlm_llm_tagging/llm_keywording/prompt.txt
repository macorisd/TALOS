I will provide you with a description of an image, generated by the LVLM LLaVA. Your task is to tell me only the objects present in the image according to the textual description. Your response should be in JSON format (I will provide an example later), and specifically, you should give the keywords for the objects in the image. The example is as follows:

Imagine I give you a description like the following:

"The image shows an indoor scene featuring a small, low wooden table or shelf against a wall with beige tiles. On top of the table, there are several items including a red envelope, some papers, and possibly books or magazines. The bottom shelf of the table appears to contain more items, but they're not clearly visible from this angle.

In front of the table, on the floor, there is a pair of shoes with black soles and white laces, indicating that someone might have recently removed them. The room has curtains that are partially open, allowing light in from outside. There doesn't seem to be any text or distinctive branding visible in this image. The style of the photograph is casual, capturing an everyday setting without any particular artistic intent."

Your response should detect the main objects of this scene and present them strictly in JSON format, without saying anything else:

"{ 
    "1" : "wooden table", 
    "2" : "shelf", 
    "3" : "wall", 
    "4" : "beige tiles", 
    "5" : "papers", 
    "6" : "books", 
    "7" : "magazines", 
    "8" : "floor", 
    "9" : "shoes", 
    "10" : "curtains", 
    "11" : "wooden table" 
}"

It is extremely important that you respect the JSON format exactly as I have shown. Write each object in lowercase. Do not write synonyms, avoid repeating objects. I emphasize the importance of these aspects because I will be using your response directly in an automated pipeline. Do not skip the format or my instructions.
