I'm going to send you an image description generated by the LVLM LLaVA. Your task is to tell me only the objects that exist in the image according to the textual description. Your response must be in JSON format (I'll provide an example later), and you should specifically list the keywords (categories) of the objects in the image.

The format of your response must be strictly JSON. It is very important that you follow the format I will explain since I will use your response directly in an automated pipeline that requires this structure. The JSON format for the detected object categories should be as follows:

"{
	"1": "table",
	"2": "dog",
	"3": "grass",
	"4": "shoe",
	"5": "",
	...
	"n": ""
}"

You must always follow this numbering format and semantic labeling. The detected categories or object labels you write will be referred to as "keywords."

Next, I will first explain some very strict and clear rules that you must always follow for your response, and then I will provide a practical example so you can see how to correctly perform your task.

The 10 strict rules for determining which object keywords to include based on the textual image description:

1. Exclude entire rooms. You should not write "kitchen", "room" or "space" as keywords because they are not objects. Your task is to specify elements found within certain spaces, not the space itself.

2. If the description mentions floors or walls, simply state "floor" or "wall". If, for example, there are tiles on the floor, do not say "tile," "tiles," or "tiled floor"—just say "floor". If there are bricks on the wall, do not say "brick wall"—just say "wall".

3. Keywords must be singular. Do not say "pair of shoes"—say "shoe". Do not say "group of people"—say "person".

4. Be general enough: Avoid including colors or very specific characteristics in the keywords. Do not say "red sofa"—say "sofa". Do not say "wooden desk"—say "desk". Do not say "acoustic guitar"—say "guitar". Do not say "sport bag"—say "bag".

5. Be specific enough: For example, if a fruit is labeled as a specific type of fruit, use that type as the keyword. If there is an apple, say "apple," not "fruit". If there is a violin, say "violin," not "instrument". If there is a cat, say "cat," not "animal".

6. Avoid generic terms like "item" or "object". If no clearly identified object is present, do not include it in your response.

7. Do not repeat identical keywords. If the image description states there are three dogs, do not write "dog" three times. The same label should not appear multiple times—just indicate it once.

8. Avoid synonyms. You should not label both "TV" and "television"—choose the more generic one ("television"). Do not use both "shoe" and "trainers"—choose the more general one ("shoe").

9. If the description is uncertain about a specific object (e.g., "what appears to be a bag or a jacket"), include all the mentioned possibilities ("bag" and "jacket").

10. If the image description indicates that no objects were clearly detected, return an empty JSON. That is perfectly fine.

These are the 10 rules you must always follow for labeling objects in JSON based on a textual description. Now, I will provide two real-case examples of how you should perform the task:


EXAMPLE 1

Imagine I send you the following description:

"The image shows an indoor scene featuring a small, low wooden table or shelf against a wall with beige tiles. On top of the table, there are several items including a red envelope, some papers, and possibly books or magazines. The bottom shelf of the table appears to contain more items, but they're not clearly visible from this angle.

In front of the table, on the floor, there is a pair of shoes with black soles and white laces, indicating that someone might have recently removed them. The room has curtains that are partially open, allowing light in from outside. There doesn't seem to be any text or distinctive branding visible in this image. The style of the photograph is casual, capturing an everyday setting without any particular artistic intent."

Your response should be as follows, strictly following the format and rules above:

"{
	"1" : "table",
	"2" : "shelf",
	"3" : "wall",
	"4" : "envelope",
	"5" : "papers",
	"6" : "book",
	"7" : "magazine",
	"8" : "floor",
	"9" : "shoe",
	"10" : "curtain"
}"


EXAMPLE 2

Imagine I send you the following description:

"The image shows an indoor scene with a focus on two main objects: a guitar and a bed. The guitar is positioned to the left of the frame, leaning against what appears to be a wall or a stand. It's a dreadnought-style acoustic guitar with visible wood tones typical of such instruments.

To the right, there is a single bed with a dark-colored mattress and bedding. The bed appears unoccupied, and it takes up most of the right side of the image. There are no people in the picture, giving the impression of an empty or quiet room.

In the foreground, there's a small pile of clothes, possibly discarded, which adds a lived-in feel to the space. The floor includes various shades of brown and beige. There are no texts visible in this image, and the style appears to be a candid or unposed photograph, likely taken without much artistic intent, perhaps as a snapshot of daily life."

Your response should be as follows, strictly following the format and rules above:

"{
	"1" : "guitar",
	"2" : "bed",
	"3" : "wall",
	"4" : "stand",
	"5" : "mattress",
	"6" : "pile of clothes",
	"7" : "floor"
}"

The explanation of your task is complete. Now, following all the previous instructions, you must produce the response for this input text:
