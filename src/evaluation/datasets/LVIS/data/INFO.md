This directory should contain the LVIS dataset's JSON data in a 'raw_data.json' file.

You can download this dataset here: https://www.lvisdataset.org/dataset (Validation set)

(Last downloaded in March 2025, please check if the format is still the same.)

After downloading the dataset, renaming the JSON to 'raw_data.json' and running format_data.py, a new script called 'formatted_data.json' should be generated in this directory.
