I am going to send you a textual description of an image. Your task is to tell me only the objects that exist in the image according to the textual description. Your answer must be in JSON format (I will show you an example later), and specifically, you will give me the keywords (categories) of the objects in the image.

The format of your response must strictly be in JSON. It is very important that you respect the format I will explain to you, since I will use your response directly in an automated pipeline that requires that format. The JSON format for the detected object categories you analyze should be as follows (a list with an undetermined number of elements):

["table", "dog", "floor", "shoe"]

You must always follow this list format with the words for the detected objects. From now on, we will refer to these detected categories or objects that you will write as "labels."

Next, I will first explain very strict and clear rules that you must always follow for your response, and then I will provide a practical example so you can see how to perform your task.

The 8 strict rules to determine which object labels you must include based on the textual description of the image are the following:

1. Do not write entire rooms. You must not write, for example, "kitchen," "room," or "space" as labels, since these are not objects but entire spaces.
2. If the description mentions floors or walls, simply say "floor" or "wall." For example, if there are tiles on the floor, do not say "tile," "tiles," or "tiled floor"; just say "floor." If there are bricks on the wall, do not say "brick wall"; just say "wall."
3. Labels must be in singular form. Do not say "pair of shoes"; say "shoe." Do not say "group of people"; say "person."
4. Avoid including colors or very specific characteristics in the labels. Do not say "red sofa"; say "sofa." Do not say "wooden desk"; say "desk." Do not say "acoustic guitar"; say "guitar." Do not say "sport bag"; say "bag."
5. You must be specific enough: for example, if there is clearly an apple, say "apple," not "fruit." If there is a violin, say "violin," not "instrument." If there is a cat, say "cat," not "animal."
6. Avoid generic terms in the labels, such as "item" or "object." If there is not a clearly identified object, do not include it in your response.
7. If the image description shows uncertainty about a specific object (for example, if it says there is "what seems to be a bag or a jacket" on top of a bed), you must include all possible mentioned objects ("bag," "jacket").
8. If the description of the image indicates that no clear object has been detected, return an empty JSON list â€” that is completely fine.

These have been the 8 rules you must always consider for object labeling in JSON based on a textual description. Now, I will give you two examples of what you should do in real cases:


EXAMPLE 1

Imagine I send you the following description:

"The image shows an indoor scene featuring a small, low wooden table or shelf against a wall with beige tiles. On top of the table, there are several items including a red envelope, some papers, and possibly books or magazines. The bottom shelf of the table appears to contain more items, but they're not clearly visible from this angle.

In front of the table, on the floor, there is a pair of shoes with black soles and white laces, indicating that someone might have recently removed them. The room has curtains that are partially open, allowing light in from outside. There doesn't seem to be any text or distinctive branding visible in this image. The style of the photograph is casual, capturing an everyday setting without any particular artistic intent."

Your response should be like this, following the format and rules explained:

["table", "shelf", "wall", "envelope", "papers", "book", "magazine", "floor", "shoe", "curtain"]


EXAMPLE 2

Imagine I send you the following description:

"The image shows an indoor scene with a focus on two main objects: a guitar and a bed. The guitar is positioned to the left of the frame, leaning against what appears to be a wall or a stand. It's a dreadnought-style acoustic guitar with visible wood tones typical of such instruments.

To the right, there is a single bed with a dark-colored mattress and bedding. The bed appears unoccupied, and it takes up most of the right side of the image. There are no people in the picture, giving the impression of an empty or quiet room.

In the foreground, there's a small pile of clothes, possibly discarded, which adds a lived-in feel to the space. The floor includes various shades of brown and beige. There are no texts visible in this image, and the style appears to be a candid or unposed photograph, likely taken without much artistic intent, perhaps as a snapshot of daily life."

Your response should be as follows, strictly following the format and rules above:

["guitar", "bed", "wall", "stand", "mattress", "pile of clothes", "floor"]


The explanation of your task has ended. Now, following all the instructions above, you must produce the response for the following input text:
