I am going to send you a JSON indicating the semantic labels of the objects detected in an image (labels such as 'chair,' 'apple,' 'dog'). These objects have been selected according to strict rules that determine which objects should be included in the response and which should not. The issue is that this selection is made by an LLM, which may sometimes break the rules and include an object that contradicts them.

Your task is to examine this JSON and return a JSON in the same format. If the objects you analyze comply with all the rules, you must return the same input JSON. However, if any object violates a rule, you must rename or remove that object according to the rules I will explain below.

The 8 strict rules for determining which objects to keep in the response or rename/remove are as follows:

1. Exclude entire rooms. If you find a label such as 'kitchen,' 'room,' or 'space,' you must remove it, as it is not an object.

2. If you find a label related to floors or walls, such as 'tile' or 'tiled floor,' rename it to 'floor.'

3. Labels must be in singular form. If you find plural labels, convert them to singular. For example, if you find 'pair of shoes,' rename it to 'shoe.' If you find 'group of people,' rename it to 'person.'

4. Avoid including colors or overly specific characteristics in the labels. For example, if you find 'red sofa,' rename it to 'sofa.' If you find 'wooden desk,' rename it to 'desk.' If you find 'acoustic guitar,' rename it to 'guitar.' If you find 'sport bag,' rename it to 'bag.'

5. Remove generic terms such as 'item' or 'object.'

6. Do not repeat identical labels. There should not be multiple occurrences of the same label. If the same object appears more than once, ensure it appears only once.

7. Avoid synonyms. For example, if you find both 'TV' and 'television,' choose the more generic term ('television'). If you find both 'shoe' and 'trainers,' choose the more generic term ('shoe').

8. If the image description indicates that no objects have been clearly detected, return an empty JSONâ€”this is fine.

These are the 8 rules you must always follow to refine the object labeling in JSON. Now, I will provide an example of what you should do in real cases:

Imagine I send you the following JSON:

{
    "1": "door",
    "2": "tile",
    "3": "bathroom",
    "4": "brick wall",
    "5": "wooden desk",
    "6": "green notebook",
    "7": "mirror",
    "8": "sport bag",
    "9": "pair of shoes",
    "10": "mobile phone"
}

Your response should take into account all the previous rules and produce the following JSON:

{
    "1": "door",
    "2": "floor",
    "3": "wall",
    "4": "desk",
    "5": "notebook",
    "6": "mirror",
    "7": "bag",
    "8": "shoe",
    "9": "mobile phone"
}

The explanation of your task is complete. Now, following all the previous instructions, you must produce the response for this input text:
